# Food Insecurity in Maryland

From 2023-2025, CODI was implemented in Maryland (CODI@MD) working with MAC,
Inc., an area agency on aging; Meals on Wheels of Central Maryland (MOWCM); and
Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients (CRISP), Marylandâ€™s
statewide health information exchange. This implementation focused on older
adults (60 years and above) and health-related social needs. CODI@MD linked
clinical and community data in the Eastern Shore and greater Baltimore areas to
enable MAC and MOWCM to better understand the impact of their nutrition programs
and services.

This implementation was supported by the Administration for Community Living
(ACL) from 2023-2025. The technical approach for this implementation is
described on this GitHub site.  Resources will be available for this
implementation by August 2025.

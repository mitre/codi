# Chronic Disease in North Carolina

In 2020, CODI was implemented in North Carolina (CODI@NC), and local
collaborators are working with healthcare, local and state health
departments, and community-based organizations to link clinical and
community data in the Triangle region to understand chronic disease.
From 2021–2023, CODI@NC further optimized the CODI infrastructure
for standardizing and linking individual- and household-level data
across clinical and community systems. CODI can help evaluate health
and lifestyle programs, track local health trends, and support
research with its data resources. For more information, please [<span

This implementation was supported by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) from 2020-2023. The technical approach implemented
in North Carolina differs from the approach described on this website
which leverages existing HIE infrastructure to connect data. A CODI
toolbox hosted by the Public Health Informatics Institute also
describes this implementation and offers processes, standards, and
tools to support partnership building, capacity assessments, and
data linking and cleaning: [<span style={{color:

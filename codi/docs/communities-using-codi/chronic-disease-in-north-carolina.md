# Chronic Disease in North Carolina

In 2020, CODI was implemented in North Carolina (CODI@NC), and local collaborators are working with healthcare, local and state health departments, and community-based organizations to link clinical and community data in the Triangle region. From 2021–2023, CODI@NC will further optimize the CODI infrastructure for standardizing and linking individual- and household-level data across clinical and community systems. Updates will enable assessment of social determinants of health (SDOH), child and adult chronic diseases, and the effects of COVID-19. For more information, please [<span style={{color: '#3B8BFF'}}>visit their website</span>](https://codinetworknc.org/front-door/). 

This implementation was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 2020-2023. The technical approach implemented in North Carolina differs from the approach described on this website. A CODI toolbox hosted by the Public Health Informatics Institute describes this implementation and offers processes, standards, and tools to support partnership building, capacity assessments, and data linking and cleaning: [<span style={{color: '#3B8BFF'}}>https://phii.org/course/codi-toolbox/</span>](https://phii.org/course/codi-toolbox/).

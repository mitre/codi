# Hypertension Control Measure Definitions

The [<span style={{color: '#3B8BFF'}}>Hypertension Control Measure
Definition</span>](../../../../codi-resources/CODI_Hypertension_Control_Measure_Definition_20250825.pdf)
document defines how hypertension control should be assessed among a general
population and within populations that received an intervention, like services
and programs provided by a community-based organization. Implementers may use
this resource to build a hypertension control measure using clinical data and
data provided by community-based organizations.

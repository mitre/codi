# Expanded Food Security Screener formatted as a FHIR Questionnaire

The [<span style={{color: '#3B8BFF'}}>Expanded Food Security Screener (FSS-Exp)</span>](../../../../codi-resources/Expanded-Food-Security-Screener-by-the-University-of-Maryland.R4.json) is a validated tool used to assess food security based on questions that ask about ability to afford food. The FSS-Exp quickly gathers information on an individualâ€™s economic access to food, their ability to get groceries into their home, and their ability to prepare meals, with or without help. This resource is a FHIR version (based on the FHIR Structured Data Capture profile) of the FSS-Exp that implementers may use to collect food security data electronically and transmit in standardized and interoperable format. To preview the questionnaire, upload the file to: [<span style={{color: '#3B8BFF'}}>NLM Form Builder</span>](https://formbuilder.nlm.nih.gov).

# Structured Data Extract Sample Data #2: Evidence-Based Programs

This example SDE file can help implementers review the contents and
structure of real world data from a CBO in the SDE format, test the
Data Model Quality Assurance Script, and/or test the Dose of Services
Measure Definition. [<span style={{color: '#3B8BFF'}}>This example
SDE</span>](https://github.com/mitre/codi/tree/main/codi-resources/sde-ww-anonymized)
includes data from four evidence-based programs: falls prevention,
diabetes self-management education, chronic disease self-management,
and chronic pain self-management. Five SDE tables and corresponding
CSV files are included:  DEMOGRAPHIC, ORGANIZATION,
PRIVATE_ADDRESS_HISTORY, PROGRAM, and PROGRAM_ENROLLMENT. Individuals
and their data have been anonymized in these files to prevent
reidentification.

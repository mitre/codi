# Structured Data Extract sample data #1: home delivered meals services, congregate meals program, and care transitions program

[<span style={{color: '#3B8BFF'}}>Example SDE files</span>](https://github.com/mitre/codi/tree/main/codi-resources/sde-mac-anonymized) can help implementers review the contents and structure of real world social care data in the SDE format, test the Data Model Quality Assurance Script, and/or test the Dose of Services Measure Definition. This example SDE includes 3 types of social care data: a home delivered meals service, a congregate meals program, and a care-transitions program. Nine SDE tables and corresponding CSV files are included:  ASSET_DELIVERY, ASSET_ENROLLMENT, CURRICULUM_COMPONENT, DEMOGRAPHIC, ORGANIZATION, PRIVATE_ADDRESS_HISTORY, PROGRAM_ENROLLMENT, PROGRAM, and SESSION. Individuals and their data have been anonymized in these files to prevent reidentification.

# Maryland Community-Based Organization Data Sharing Implementation Guidance

The [<span style={{color: '#3B8BFF'}}>Maryland CBO Data Sharing Implementation
Guidance</span>](../../../../codi-resources/MD_CBO_Data_Sharing_Implementation_Guidance_20250807.pdf)
is a planning document that provides guidance to CBOs who are interested in
sharing data with CRISP about screening and assessment data, which identify
individual needs, and the programs or services provided to address those needs.
This document was created during the Maryland CODI pilot implementation.
Implementers outside of Maryland can use this as a template for what a guidance
document can look like for HIEs interested in engaging CBOs in their community
about data sharing.

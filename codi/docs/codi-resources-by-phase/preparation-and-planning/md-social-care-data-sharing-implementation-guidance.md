# Maryland Social Care Data Sharing Implementation Guidance

The [<span style={{color: '#3B8BFF'}}>Maryland Social Care Data Sharing Implementation Guidance</span>](../../../../codi-resources/CODI_MD_CRISP_Social_Care_Data_Implementation_Guidance_20250425.pdf) is a planning document that provides guidance to CBOs who are interested in sharing social care data with CRISP. This document was created during the Maryland CODI pilot and is an example of the content and direction to engage CBOs in starting to share social care data with an HIE. Implementers outside of Maryland can use this as a template for what a guidance document can look like for their community.

CODI@CO linked child health-related data from three health systems (Denver Public Health & Hospital Authority, Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, and Kaiser Permanente Colorado) and two community-based organizations (Girls on the Run of the Rockies and Hunger Free Colorado). Analytic results are providing information on growth and clinical action for children with excess weight; how contact hours and frequency of participation in weight management interventions affect health; and local child obesity prevalence (CODI Overview).
